# WBS-Mapping-Model

This is a brief overview of some key components in my SVM Multi-Class Text Classification script.

In order to maintain the confidentially of the data and its context, I am restricted from posting the source code or any .ipynb files, so I have uploaded a PDF snippet containing some key components of my script with their corresponding outputs and visualizations presented appropriately.
